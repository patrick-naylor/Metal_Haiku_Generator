It is a very thematic track, predominantly examining the horror cliche of zombies in the form of music and lyricism. I challenge you to imagine a zombie movie, television show, comic, graphic novel, or video game as you listen and read these lyrics. In some respects this song is serious, in others not so much. You can take from it whatever you so choose! Major influences include Wolves in the Throne Room and a variety of experimental music acts.\\nI intend to build off of this track and explore this theme in more depth on a yet unnamed album, which will be my first as Ethereal Morning Rise.\\nparoles\\nRelease her body like nectar formed\\nOn Golgotha display the human flesh\\nCovering the spirits of the carnal dead\\nSubmerged in the blood of a

Seeking freedom in banners of red and black, the sweet taste of autonomy, the promise of freedom in the land of the wretched, the illusions of wealth in the land of the decrepit. Living not in America but under America, slaving in mills, factories, prisons and gallows. Such unhappy luck, to become a revolutionary of misfortune, shaping history through martyrdom, living forever in the hearts of the rebellious and free. Seven years behind bars, but no jail can imprison ideas. As gentlemen led to their doom, humble and strong, the priest they refuse, they die not for their crime, but for anarchism and liberty. \"Our words, our lives, our pains... the taking of our lives... the last moment belongs to us.
