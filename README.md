# Metal Haiku Generator

Welcome to the Metal Lyrics Haiku Generation Project! This repository contains the necessary resources to explore the fusion of metal lyrics and haiku poetry using neural networks.

### Project Overview
The project consists of two main Jupyter Notebooks:

1) scraping.ipynb: This notebook utilizes the Beautiful Soup library to scrape metal lyrics from metal-archives.com. It focuses on bands based in the United States to primarily retrieve English lyrics. The scraped lyrics are then tokenized and preprocessed for subsequent use.

2) Model.ipynb: This notebook delves into the realm of neural networks. It takes the preprocessed metal lyrics and employs a sequence-to-sequence model to generate haikus. The model is trained to capture the essence of metal lyrics and distill them into the structured elegance of haikus.

### Acknowledgments

This project is an exploration of the creative possibilities at the intersection of technology and art. It demonstrates how neural networks can be used to blend the intensity of metal lyrics with the elegance of traditional Japanese haikus.

Feel free to experiment, modify, and expand upon this project to further explore the depths of AI-generated art.

Happy haiku generating! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ“œ
